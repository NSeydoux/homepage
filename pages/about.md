I studied computer science at [INSA](http://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en/index.html) Toulouse, a French engineering school. I graduated in 2015 and got a double diploma: Software and networks engineer from INSA, and a MS in Artificial Intelligence, Collaborative Intelligence and Interaction from the [Paul Sabbatier university](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/home/home-page-en-379161.kjsp?RH=ACCUEIL). I then joined [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/) and  [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en), two computer science laboratories in Toulouse, for my PhD. At LAAS-CNRS, I was part of the [SARA team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/sara), specialised in Services and Networks, in the [IoT group](https://www.laas.fr/projects/IOT/) , and at IRIT my team was [MELODI](https://www.irit.fr/-MELODI-Team-?lang=en), specialised in Discourse and Semantics, in the semantic web group. I defended my PhD in October 2018 after 3 years, and worked as a lecturer at INSA for the school year 2018-2019.

I then joined [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/) to work on [the Solid project](https://solidproject.org/). My focus is on developer tooling, developping libraries to make it easier to write applications using Linked Data in general, and part of the Solid ecosystem in particular.
