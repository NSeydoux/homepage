@phdthesis{thesisseydoux,
	title = {Towards interoperable {IOT} systems with a constraint-aware semantic web of things},
	url = {https://hal.laas.fr/tel-02093952},
	abstract = {This thesis is situated in the Semantic Web of things (SWoT) domain, at the interface between the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Semantic Web (SW). The integration of SW approaches into the IoT aim at tackling the important heterogeneity of resources, technologies and applications in the IoT, which creates interoperability issues impeding the deployment of IoT systems. A first scientific challenge is risen by the resource consumption of the SW technologies, inadequated to the limites computation and communication capabilities of IoT devices. Moreover, IoT networks are deployed at a large scale, when SW technologies have scalability issues. This thesis addresses this double challenge by two contributions. The first one is the identification of quality criteria for IoT ontologies, leading to the proposition of IoT-O, a modular IoT ontology. IoT-O is deployed to enrich data from a smart building, and drive semIoTics, our autonomic computing application. The second co! ntribution is EDR (Emergent Distributed Reasoning), a generic approach to dynamically distributed rule-based reasoning. Rules are propagated peer-to-peer, guided by descriptions exchanged among nodes. EDR is evaluated in two use-cases, using both a server and some constrained nodes to simulate the deployment.},
