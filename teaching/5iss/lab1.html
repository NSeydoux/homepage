<h1>Semantic Web of Things labs</h1>
<h2>Overall context</h2>
<p>
  During this two-part lab series, you will develop what could be the foundation
  for a smart city wheater app. To do this, data from wheater station will be
  annotated so that they go up <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">the linked data hierarchy</a>.
</p>
<p>
  First, you'll build a (simplified) meteorology ontology to have a vocabulary
  you'll be able to use to describe data (remember, that's the <a href="https://zwifi.eu/slides/teaching/5iss/?full#74">
  definition of what an ontology is</a>). You'll be using Protégé, a graphical
  ontology editor, to manipulate the main components of an ontology.
</p>
<p>
  Then, you'll use that ontology to describe data from an <a href="http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/datasets.html">open data</a>
  published by Aarhus, a Danish city. This data is a set of observations collected
  by wheater stations, recorded in CSV. You'll convert them into 5-star Linked 
  Data thanks to the ontology you've built.
</p>

<h1>Semantic Web of Things: Lab 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  The intent of these lab is to have you create an ontology step by step so that
  you get accointed with its main components. You will also use a reasoner to
  see what automatic deductions can be made thorough the lifecycle of the ontology
  design.
</p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Download <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege">Protégé</a>,
      an ontology editing tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run Protégé (<code>./run.sh</code> in the archive you've downloaded).
      You can skip installing plugins.
    </li>
    <li>
      When Protégé has started, go to <code>File/Preferences</code>, and then 
      to the <code>New Entities</code> tab. Select <code>Auto-generated ID</code>
      instead of <code>User-supplied name</code>. This setting sets a clear
      boundary between human-oriented names, encoded in labels, and machine-oriented
      names, encoded in opaque IRIs. Make sure that the language tag matches
      the language you'll be using.
    </li>
    <li class="warning">
      Protégé is not always very stable, and may crash during the lab. Make sure
      you save your progress <u>regularily</u>.
    </li>
  </ul> 
</p>
<h2>Designing the ontology</h2>
<p>
  You will now start building the ontology. Its requirements are the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Being able to describe wheather events (shower, sunshine...)
    </li>
    <li>
      Being able to describe parameters related to these events (temperature, pressure...)
    </li>
    <li>
      Being able to describe wheather stations observations
    </li>
    <li>
      Being able to link observations to events
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Designing a lightwheight ontology</h3>
<p>
  Translate the following statements into ontology elements by creating <em>classes</em>:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <u>Nice weather</u> and <u>Bad weather</u> are two types of <u>Weather event</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Shower</u> and <u>Fog</u> are two types of <u>Bad weather</u>, <u>Sunshine</u>
      is a type of <u>Nice weather</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Observable parameter</u>, <u>Instant</u> and <u>Observation</u>
    are additional classes in the ontology.
    </li>
    <li><u>City</u>, <u>Country</u> and <u>Continents</u> are types of <u>Places</u>.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Translate the following statements into ontology elements by adding properties.
  Link these properties to the classes you've just created by setting their
  <code>Domain</code> and <code>Range</code>. Note that two types of properties
  are available: <code>Object properties</code>, linking two class instances,
  and <code>Data properties</code>, linking a class instance to a litteral (string,
  numerical value, date...).
  <ol>
    <li>
      A <u>Weather event</u> <u>is characterized by</u> <u>Observable parameters</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Weather event</u> <u>has a duration</u> expressed as an <code>xsd:float</code>
      value (in minutes).
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Weather event</u> <u>starts at</u> an <u>Instant</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Weather event</u> <u>ends at</u> an <u>Instant</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <u>Instant</u> <u>has for date</u> an <code>xsd:dateTimeStamp</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Weather event</u> <u>has for symptom</u> an <u>Observation</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <u>Observation</u> <u>measures</u> an <u>Observable parameter</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <u>Observation</u> <u>has for value</u> an <code>xsd:float</code>. 
      Modelling units is out of scope for this lab.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <u>Observation</u> <u>is located in</u> a <u>Place</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <u>Observation</u> <u>is dated at</u> an <u>Instant</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Place</u> <u>is located in</u> another <u>Place</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Place</u> <u>is the location of</u> another <u>Place</u>
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Country</u> <u>has for capital</u> a <u>City</u>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3>Populating the knowledge base</h3>
<p>
  Implement the following statements using the ontology you just built, by
  instantiating individuals and adding <code>Object property assertions</code>
  and <code>Data property assertions</code> to describe them. After
  <emp>each</emp> statement, run the reasoner (pick <code>Hermitt</code> in 
  the <code>Reasoner</code> tab, then press <code>CTRL+R</code> each time you
  want the reasoner to run). <emp>Document the deductions in the lab report</emp>.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <u>Temperature</u>, <u>Hygrometry</u>, <u>Rainfall</u>, <u>Athmospheric
      pressure</u>, <u>Wind speed</u> and <u>Wind strength</u> are instances of
      <u>Observable parameter</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Température</u> is a French synonym to <ul>Temperature</ul>. Add it
      as a label (properly setting the language tag) in the individual's
      annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Wind speed</u> and <u>Wind strength</u> are equivalent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toulouse is located in France. Note that the individuals <emp>are not typed</emp>
      in the statement: do <emp>not</emp> create them as a City or a Country, but
      as untyped individuals. <emp>What does the reasoner infer ?</emp>
    </li>
    <li>
      Toulouse is a City.
    </li>
    <li>
      Paris is the capital of France. Create Paris as an untyped individual.
    </li>
    <li>
      10/11/2015 at 10AM is an instant wel'll call <emp>I1</emp>. Its timestamp
      is <code>2015-11-10T10:00:00Z</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      P1 is an observation measuring a value of 3mm of rainfall at Toulouse
      at moment I1.
    </li>
    <li>
      A1 has for symptom P1.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Designing a heavy ontology</h3>
<p>
  You will now add logical axioms to the ontology to make it more expressive.
  Express the following statements in the ontology. Note that some definitions
  are provided <a href="https://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Primer#Property_Characteristics">here</a>
  to explain the properties characteristics you can set in Protégé.
  <ol>
    <li>
      A City instance cannot be a Country instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Short Event</u> is a <u>Weather Event</u> that lasts less than 15 minutes.
      Create the <u>Short Event</u> class, and add the following axiom to its
      equivalent classes: <code>Event that ’has for duration’ some xsd:float
      [< 15]</code>. Note that you may need to adjust the class and property
      names according to your own choices in the previous questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Long Event</u> is a <u>Weather Event</u> that lasts more than 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      The property <u>is located in</u> is the inverse of <u>is location of</u>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If some Place <i>A</i> is located in some place <i>B</i>, and <i>B</i>
      is located in <i>C</i>, then <i>A</i> is located in <i>C</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A City can only be the capital of one Coutry, and a Country may only have
      one capital.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a City is the capital of a Country, then this City is located in that
      Country. Hint: use the notion of sub-properties.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <u>Shower</u> is a <u>Weather Event</u> that <u>has for symptom</u> a
      <u>Rainfall</u> <u>Observation</u> which <u>value</u> is more than zero:
      <code>'Weather Event' that ’has for symptom’ some (Observation that ('measures'
        value Rainfall) and (’has value some xsd:float [>
        0]))</code>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3>Populating the ontology</h3>
<p>
  As you did previously, for each assertion, observe the deductions from the
  reasoner and document relevant information in your lab report.
  <ul>
    <li>
      France is in Europe.
    </li>
    <li>
      The City of Lights is the capital of France.
    </li>
    <li>
      Singapore is both a City and a Country.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, what does the reasoner say about <code>A1</code> ?
